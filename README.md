## ❓ FAQ

**Where are my pins stored?**
- Local pins/folders: stored in .codepin.local.json (not shared).
- Team pins/folders: stored in .codepin.team.json (shared via git, if you commit it)

**How do I backup or share pins?**
- Just copy these files to another workspace or repo.

**Is my code/data sent anywhere?**
- No. All your pin data stays local, except license checks which go to Gumroad.

**What happens if I uninstall Codepin?**
- Your pins remain in your project folders.

**Why is Codepin not completely free?**

Building and maintaining Codepin takes time.  
The free version covers most needs for individual developers or smaller projects,  
and Codepin Pro is for those working in bigger teams,
with larger projects, or anyone who wants more flexibility and/or features.  

The Pro license helps support future development for Codepin.
